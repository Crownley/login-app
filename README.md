## About Login App:

- Front end was made with React.
- Back end was made with Laravel.
- The application has two main routes: "/" for login and "/dashboard" after logging in. 
- There is a fixture with credentials.
- It is using MySQL database.


## Review

- Even throught the back-end was an easy task, the front end still has few flows.
- Due to lack of time, could not finish the front end properly.
